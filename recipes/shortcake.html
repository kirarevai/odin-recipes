    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This strawberry shortcake is the classic, biscuit-style shortcake — not the pound cake variety. The cake is sliced in half and layered with sweet juicy strawberries and whipped cream for a delicious summer treat!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
            <li>Strawberries: Of course, a strawberry shortcake needs strawberries. This recipe calls for six cups of fresh strawberries.</li>Flour: This strawberry shortcake is made almost like biscuits, so you'll need 2 ¼ cups of all-purpose flour.
           <li>Baking Powder: Baking powder helps the shortcake rise.</li> 
           <li>Salt: Just a hint of salt adds a depth of flavor to the shortcake.</li> 
           <li>Butter: Butter is a classic shortcake ingredient.</li> 
            <li>Egg: One egg binds the dough together.</li>
           <li>Half-and-half: This will make the dough rich and moist, but reviewers say they've also had success using milk instead.</li>
           <li> Whipped Heavy Cream: Sweetened vanilla whipped cream tops this cake.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps
    </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prep the berries: Slice the strawberries and cover them with white sugar.</li>
        <li>Make the batter: Combine the dry ingredients, then cut in the butter until the mixture is crumbly. Add the egg and half-and-half and stir until combined.</li>
<li>Bake the cake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until golden brown.</li>
<li>Assemble the strawberry shortcake: Cut the cake in half. Top the bottom layer with half the strawberries, then replace the top of the cake. Top the cake with the remaining berries and whipped cream.</li>    </ol>
