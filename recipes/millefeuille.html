<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This Napoleon dessert is made with frozen puff pastry sheets.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry dough, thawed</li>

        <li>2  teaspoons white sugar, or as needed for dusting</li>
        
        <li>3 sheets aluminum foil</li>
        
        <li>1 sheet parchment paper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat.</li>

<li>Separate dough at the seams into 4 squares and place on the prepared baking sheet. Prick dough all over with the tines of a fork. Lightly sprinkle with sugar.</li>

<li>Cover with 1 sheet parchment paper, then 3 sheets aluminum foil. Nest another baking sheet on top to apply pressure to dough while it bakes.</li>

<li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the top baking sheet and foil; gently peel off parchment paper. Continue baking until pastry is browned, 10 to 15 minutes. (Alternatively, you can bake about 7 minutes after uncovering, flip sheets over, and bake until brown on the other side, about 7 more minutes.)</li>

<li>Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely before cutting.</li>

<li>Use a sharp serrated knife with a light sawing motion to square sheets by trimming uneven edges. Cut each rectangle crosswise into 3 equal rectangles. Use 3 rectangles per pastry.</li>
</ol>
